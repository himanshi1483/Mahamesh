                    Great Mahatma Gandhi honoured <strong>'Goat as poor man's Cow'</strong> knowing its importance in upliftment of socioeconomic status of poor / marginal farmers. Sheep and Goat were the first food producing animals to be domesticated around 8000 BC in southeast Asia. Sheep and Goat are reared for meat, milk, hide, skin, wool, hairs and manure production. Sheep and Goat rearing is mainly concentrated in dry and scarcity areas.

                    Breed of sheep in Maharashtra is known as  <strong>'Deshi' or 'Deccani'</strong>. This breed is not quite pure one. The yield of wool obtained from these sheep is not only low in quality but also of inferior quality. This wool is therefore used mainly for the production of country blankets. The sheep on Maharashtra are therefore reared mainly for meat and manure. Apart from wool and meat sheep are valued for their manure, some income also comes from sheep hairs. Inspire of these advantages and facts the status of shepherd community in the state has not appreciably improved. The nomadic and unstable life of breeders, their poor land holdings and financial positions, their illiteracy and ignorance about the improved techniques of breeding, feeding and management, wool harvesting and disease control measures are factors responsible for the backwardness of shepherd community in the state.

                    To ameliorate the conditions of shepherd community in the state it was felt necessary to provide i. Better feeding facilities for the genetic improvement of the native sheep for higher production, both under stationary and nomadic type ii. Better feeding for both stationary and nomadic type iii. Intensive health cover and diagnostic facilities. iv. Services in wool harvesting and classification. v. Suitable marketing facilities know how about sheep rearing. In order to achieve this Government of Maharashtra vide its G.R.
