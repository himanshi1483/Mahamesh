                        <p>The sheep breeders from main market place “Madgyal ” and its adjacent villages of Jat, Taluka, Dist. Sangali, have evolved a fast growing & most beneficial mutton purpose sheep breed called “Madgyal” by applying selection procedure. As this Sheep has promising quality of rapid weight gain, there is increasing demand for breeding males of this breed in adjacent areas for up gradation of local Flocks.</p>
                        <p>For conservation of this breed, Corporation submitted a breed conservation proposal to Government of India & GOI have sanctioned Rs. 64.50 lakhs during 2005-2006 Under this Scheme, the breeding programme has started by purchasing 500 Madgyal ewes & 20 rams at Ranjani, Dist. Sangali farm. The rams thus produced are distributed to farmers for breed improvement.  </p>
                        <p>The fund of Rs. 10.00 lakh have been released to the Corporation during March 2010 for continuation of the scheme. From these funds the works of purchase of Madgyal sheep and rams, strengthening of irrigation facilities for increased fodder production have been completed at Ranjani, Dist. Sangali farm</p>

                        <p>In Maharashtra, there are no exclusive sheep & goat markets. They are sold at same place, where other animals are being sold. These markets are still underdeveloped and lack required facilities such as Ramp for loading & unloading; shelter for livestock; drinking water; facilities for sale /purchase of feed & fodder; Veterinary Dispensary; office for sheep & goat insurance, weighing machines etc. Therefore these markets need to be strengthened. Corporation has, therefore, proposed to establish 10 small ruminant market yards at the APMC markets where the trade of small ruminants is relatively high. Government has released Rs. 375.00 lakhs in the year 2010-11for establishment of 5 market yards in the state. During year 2011-12 Rs. 375.00 lakh will be release to the Corporation. The scheme is being implemented in 10 following APMCs in the State.</p>
